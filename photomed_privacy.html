PhotoMed Pro Privacy Policy

Welcome to PhotoMed Pro, operated by Bob Casaer ("we", "our", or "us"). We value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your data when you use our mobile application.

1. Information We Collect
When you use PhotoMed Pro, we may collect the following personal and usage information:
 a. First name
 b. Email address
 d. Images and photos you capture or upload
 e. Metadata related to your usage (e.g., image edits, feature use)

2. How We Use Your Information
We use your information to:
  a. Provide core app features such as image capture, ghost image overlays, and collage creation
  b. Allow you to store images in third-party storage (Dropbox, Google Drive)
  c. Personalize and improve your experience
  d. Respond to inquiries and support requests
  e. Ensure application security and prevent misuse

We do not use your images for training AI models or for any purpose other than user-requested services.

3. Cloud Storage Integrations
PhotoMed Pro offers integration with Dropbox and Google Drive to allow users to store and access their media files. We do not access or view your files beyond what is necessary to provide this service. Access to third-party accounts is handled securely via OAuth, and your credentials are not stored on our servers.

4. Advertising and Analytics
We may use third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) to understand user behavior and improve the app. We do not sell your personal data. Any advertising, if used, will be limited and non-intrusive.

5. Data Storage and Security
All personal and image data is securely transmitted and, if stored on our servers (e.g., for temporary processing), is encrypted using industry-standard protocols. We follow best practices to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure.

6. Your Rights
You have the right to:
 a. Access the personal data we hold about you
 b. Request correction or deletion of your data
 c. Revoke permissions to third-party services at any time
You can manage these preferences within the app or contact us at infophotomedpro@gmail.com.

7. Data Retention
Your data is retained only as long as necessary to provide services or until you request deletion. Deleting your account will also remove all associated personal and image data from our systems.

8. Childrenâ€™s Privacy
PhotoMed Pro is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from children under 13. If you believe a child has used our app, please contact us for prompt removal.

9. International Users
PhotoMed Pro primarily serves users outside the EU. However, we are committed to compliance with international data protection regulations, including GDPR, where applicable.

10. Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy periodically. You will be notified of significant changes through the app or via email.

11.Subscriptions
PhotoMed Pro operates on a subscription model. By purchasing a subscription, you gain access to premium features of the app. Subscriptions are managed through your app store account (Apple App Store or Google Play Store). You are responsible for managing and canceling your subscription through the respective app store.
 a. No refunds are issued for unused portions of a subscription term.
 b. If your subscription lapses or is canceled, your access to premium features will be restricted.
 c. Some free features may remain available, but full functionality requires an active subscription

12.Use of Face Data
We use on-device facial landmark detection solely to enable face-specific zoom features, such as focusing on eyes or nose. This processing is handled entirely by your device using system-level APIs (like Apple Vision). We do not store, collect, share, or transmit any face data. All face-related processing is temporary and discarded after use.
